Hotel Booking Prediction Using Machine Learning
Introduction
In the hospitality industry, predicting hotel booking cancellations is crucial for effective revenue management and resource allocation. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled. By using a classification model, we can provide insights and predictions that help hotels optimize their operations and improve customer satisfaction.

Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of various features related to hotel bookings. These features include:

hotel: The type of hotel, either Resort Hotel (H1) or City Hotel (H2).
is_canceled: Indicates if the booking was canceled (1) or not (0).
lead_time: The number of days between the booking date and the arrival date.
arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month, arrival_date_week_number, arrival_date_day_of_month: Details about the arrival date.
stays_in_weekend_nights, stays_in_week_nights: Number of weekend and weekday nights stayed or booked.
adults, children, babies: Number of adults, children, and babies included in the booking.
meal: Type of meal booked, such as Bed & Breakfast (BB) or Full Board (FB).
country: Country of origin of the guest.
market_segment, distribution_channel: Market segment and distribution channel, such as Travel Agents (TA) or Tour Operators (TO).
is_repeated_guest: Indicates if the booking is from a repeated guest.
previous_cancellations, previous_bookings_not_canceled: Previous booking history.
reserved_room_type, assigned_room_type: Room types reserved and assigned.
booking_changes: Number of changes made to the booking.
deposit_type: Type of deposit made, if any.
agent, company: IDs of the travel agency and company responsible for the booking.
days_in_waiting_list: Number of days the booking was on the waiting list.
customer_type: Type of booking, such as Contract or Group.
adr: Average Daily Rate.
required_car_parking_spaces: Number of car parking spaces required.
total_of_special_requests: Number of special requests made by the customer.
reservation_status, reservation_status_date: Reservation status and the date of the last status update.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing
The first step involves preprocessing the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features. This ensures that the data is clean and suitable for model training. For example, categorical variables like hotel, meal, and customer_type are encoded using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding. Numerical features such as lead_time and adr are normalized to ensure uniformity across the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset. Visualization tools such as Power BI and Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are used to create plots and charts. This helps in understanding the distribution of bookings, cancellation patterns, and the impact of different features on booking cancellations. For instance, visualizing the lead_time distribution helps in identifying whether longer lead times correlate with higher cancellation rates.

Model Training
A classification model is used to predict booking cancellations. Various machine learning algorithms are considered, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.

Results and Insights
The final model provides predictions on whether a booking will be canceled. Visualizations are created to present key insights, such as the importance of different features in predicting cancellations. For instance, features like lead_time, previous_cancellations, and deposit_type may significantly influence the likelihood of cancellations. These insights help hotels in making informed decisions about overbooking strategies, resource allocation, and customer engagement.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting hotel booking cancellations. By using a classification model, hotels can proactively manage cancellations, optimize occupancy rates, and improve overall operational efficiency. The insights gained from data visualization further aid in understanding booking patterns and enhancing customer satisfaction.
