Flight Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Overview

In the new technological era, air travel has become an essential aspect of our lives, whether for business, leisure, visiting loved ones, or returning to our home countries. Despite the excitement of traveling by airplane, planning a trip can be challenging due to the fluctuating nature of flight prices. This uncertainty in airline prices often makes it difficult to plan trips efficiently and budget effectively.

By leveraging historical flight data and predictive modeling techniques, this project aims to provide travelers with insights into future flight prices, enabling them to plan their trips more efficiently and manage their travel budgets better.

Project Goals

To address the issue of fluctuating flight prices and assist travelers in making informed decisions, our goal is to create a robust machine learning model that can accurately estimate flight rates based on various criteria such as:

Airline
Departure and arrival locations
Booking time
Other relevant information
Through this project, we hope to enhance and optimize the overall travel experience by offering a reliable tool for predicting flight prices, thereby enabling travelers to make well-informed decisions and optimize their travel expenses.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of flight fare data gathered from the KAYAK website using web scraping techniques. The data was collected to provide users with information that allows them to make educated decisions about when to purchase airline tickets. By analyzing historical airline costs, users can identify the optimal times to buy tickets and potentially save money.
